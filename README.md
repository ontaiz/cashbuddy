## Getting Started Locally

### Prerequisites

- Node.js version `22.14.0` (use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) for easy version management)
- npm (comes with Node.js)

cd cashbuddy
```

2. Use the correct Node.js version:
```bash
nvm use
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

4. Set up environment variables:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```
Then edit `.env` file with your Supabase credentials and other required configuration.

```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Authentication Architecture

CashBuddy implements server-side authentication using Supabase Auth with the following architecture:

### Key Components

1. **Server-Side Session Management**
   - Uses `@supabase/ssr` for proper SSR cookie handling
   - Middleware validates sessions on every request
   - Automatic redirects for protected routes

2. **Authentication Flow**
   - Login/Register pages â†’ API endpoints (`/api/auth/login`, `/api/auth/logout`)
   - Session stored in HTTP-only cookies for security
   - User data passed from Astro to React components via props

3. **Route Protection**
   - **Public routes**: `/login`, `/register`, `/password-reset`, `/update-password`
   - **Protected routes**: `/dashboard`, `/expenses`, and all API endpoints
   - Logged-in users accessing auth pages are redirected to `/dashboard`
   - Non-authenticated users accessing protected routes are redirected to `/login`

4. **Client-Side State**
   - Zustand store manages auth state in React components
   - Initial user data hydrated from Astro server
   - AuthStatus component displays user info and logout functionality

### Password Reset Flow
1. **Request Reset** - User enters email at `/password-reset`
2. **Email Sent** - Supabase sends email with reset link containing auth token
3. **Local Testing** - Check emails at `http://localhost:54324` (Inbucket)
4. **Token Processing** - Browser client processes token from URL fragment
5. **Update Password** - User sets new password at `/update-password`

### Security Features
- HTTP-only, secure cookies with SameSite protection
- CSRF protection via cookie-based sessions
- User data isolation - each user sees only their own expenses
- Proper session validation on both server and API routes
- Password reset tokens with expiration
